      “If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.”
  
      “That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you to another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book. It's geometrically progressive - all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.”
  
      “It is only a novel... or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language”
  
      “A book is a garden, an orchard, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of counselors.”
  
      “When I discovered libraries, it was like having Christmas every day.”
  
      “I love the way that each book—any book—is its own journey. You open it, and off you go….”
  
      “Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that's where it should stay.”
  
      “I still love books. Nothing a computer can do can compare to a book. You can't really put a book on the Internet. Three companies have offered to put books by me on the Net, and I said, 'If you can make something that has a nice jacket, nice paper with that nice smell, then we'll talk.' All the computer can give you is a manuscript. People don't want to read manuscripts. They want to read books. Books smell good. They look good. You can press it to your bosom. You can carry it in your pocket.”
  
      “Which of us has not felt that the character we are reading in the printed page is more real than the person standing beside us?”
  
      “Second hand books are wild books, homeless books; they have come together in vast flocks of variegated feather, and have a charm which the domesticated volumes of the library lack.”
  
      “There is no reason why the same man should like the same books at eighteen and at forty-eight”
  
      “I guess there are never enough books.”
  
      “I went away in my head, into a book. That was where I went whenever real life was too hard or too inflexible.”
  
      “The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went on olden-day sailing ships with Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village.”
  
      “People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book.”
  
      “Stephenie Meyer: Her vampires are sparkly, which I think we can all agree is wrong.”
  
      “There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.
      “The odd thing about people who had many books was how they always wanted more.”
  
      “What are you doing with all those books anyway?" Ron asked. 
      “I love books. I like that the moment you open one and sink into it you can escape from the world, into a story that's way more interesting that yours will ever be.”
  
      “The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.”
  
      “A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.”
  
      “The books are to remind us what asses and fool we are. They're Caeser's praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, "Remember, Caeser, thou art mortal." Most of us can't rush around, talking to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we haven't time, money or that many friends. The things you're looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.”
  
      “There's nothing wrong with reading a book you love over and over. When you do, the words get inside you, become a part of you, in a way that words in a book you've read only once can't.”
  
      “Despite the enormous quantity of books, how few people read! And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day.”
  
      “A book is a gift you can open again and again.”
  
      “Elend: I kind of lost track of time…
      “In books I have traveled, not only to other worlds, but into my own.”
  
      “Fools have a habit of believing that everything written by a famous author is admirable. For my part I read only to please myself and like only what suits my taste.”
  
      “Libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries.”
