      “The covers of this book are too far apart.”
  
      “If you don’t like to read, you haven’t found the right book.”
  
      “Books make great gifts because they have whole worlds inside of them. And it's much cheaper to buy somebody a book than it is to buy them the whole world!”
  
      “Honesty is the first chapter of the book wisdom.”
  
      “He liked the mere act of reading, the magic of turning scratches on a page into words inside his head.”
  
      “A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor — such is my idea of happiness.”
  
      “Why can't people just sit and read books and be nice to each other?”
  
      “So many people enter and leave your life! Hundreds of thousands of people! You have to keep the door open so they can come in! But it also means you have to let them go!”
  
      “I have a passion for teaching kids to become readers, to become comfortable with a book, not daunted. Books shouldn't be daunting, they should be funny, exciting and wonderful; and learning to be a reader gives a terrific advantage.”
  
      “Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand.”
  
      “We live and breathe words.”
  
      “A book is a dream that you hold in your hands."
      “I know every book of mine by its smell, and I have but to put my nose between the pages to be reminded of all sorts of things.”
  
      “Fiction reveals truth that reality obscures.”
  
      “Books are always obviously having conversations with other books, and some times they're amiable and sometimes not.”
  
      “Fiction is art and art is the triumph over chaos… to celebrate a world that lies spread out around us like a bewildering and stupendous dream.”
  
      “We have come from God, and inevitably the myths woven by us, though they contain error, will also reflect a splintered fragment of the true light, the eternal truth that is with God. Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil.”
  
      “From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.”
  
      “I would be most content if my children grew up to be the kind of people who think decorating consists mostly of building enough bookshelves.”
  
      “Only bad books have good endings.
      “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."
      “They turned to Angel. "We will call you Little One," the leader said, obviously deciding to dispense with the whole confusing name thing.
      “Literature is news that stays news.”
  
      “I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, 'Where's the self-help section?' She said if she told me, it would defeat the purpose.”
  
      “
      “The world was a terrible place, cruel, pitiless, dark as a bad dream. Not a good place to live. Only in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness - and love. Books loved anyone who opened them, they gave you security and friendship and didn't ask anything in return; they never went away, never, not even when you treated them badly.”
  
      “Take no heed of her.... She reads a lot of books.”
  
      “So Matilda’s strong young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships on the sea. These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message: You are not alone.”
  
      “Give me books, French wine, fruit, fine weather and a little music played out of doors by somebody I do not know.”
  
      “I can talk to fish!" Angel said happily, water dripping off her long, skinny body. "Ask one over for dinner," Fang said, joining us.”
