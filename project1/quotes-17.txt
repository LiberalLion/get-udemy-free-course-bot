      “The best stories don't come from "good vs. bad" but "good vs. good.”
  
      “I even love the smell of books.”
  
      “Only my books anoint me, 
      “Reading gives us someplace to go when we have to stay where we are.”
  
      “The world is a hellish place, and bad writing is destroying the quality of our suffering.”
  
      “Children deprived of words become school dropouts; dropouts deprived of hope behave delinquently. Amateur censors blame delinquency on reading immoral books and magazines, when in fact, the inability to read anything is the basic trouble.”
  
      “It was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn't want to move around very much.”
  
      “Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.”
  
      “For books are more than books, they are the life, the very heart and core of ages past, the reason why men worked and died, the essence and quintessence of their lives.”
  
      “She closed the book and put her cheek against it. There was still an odor of a library on it, of dust, leather, binding glue, and old paper, one book carrying the smell of hundreds.”
  
      “I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it. We must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capable of resuscitating the body and the soul.”
  
      “Reading is not an end to itself, but a means to an end.”
  
      “I leapt eagerly into books. The characters’ lives were so much more interesting than the lonely heartbeat of my own.”
  
      “I can imagine no greater bliss than to lie about, reading novels all day.”
  
      “What kind of life can you have in a house without books?”
  
      “Books - the best antidote against the marsh-gas of boredom and vacuity”
  
      “There is something wonderful about a book. We can pick it up. We can heft it. We can read it. We can set it down. We can think of what we have read. It does something for us. We can share great minds, great actions, and great undertakings in the pages of a book.”
  
      “Until then I had thought each book spoke of the things, human or divine, that lie outside books. Now I realized that not infrequently books speak of books: it is as if they spoke among themselves. In the light of this reflection, the library seemed all the more disturbing to me. It was then the place of a long, centuries-old murmuring, an imperceptible dialogue between one parchment and another, a living thing, a receptacle of powers not to be ruled by a human mind, a treasure of secrets emanated by many minds, surviving the death of those who had produced them or had been their conveyors.”
  
      “Experience is the best teacher.”
  
      “If a book is well written, I always find it too short.”
  
      “Never put off till tomorrow the book you can read today.”
  
      “We need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.”
  
      “A word to the unwise.
      “A library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people. It is a never failing spring in the desert.”
  
      “A stereotype becomes a stereotype when a significant percentage of the population appears to conform to it.”
  
      “When you re-read a classic you do not see in the book more than you did before. You see more in you than there was before.”
  
      “I had found my religion: nothing seemed more important to me than a book. I saw the library as a temple.”
  
      “There weren't any curtains in the windows, and the books that didn't fit into the bookshelf lay piled on the floor like a bunch of intellectual refugees.”
  
      “I wanted to live among books.”
  
      “His habit of reading isolated him: it became such a need that after being in company for some time he grew tired and restless; he was vain of the wider knowledge he had acquired from the perusal of so many books, his mind was alert, and he had not the skill to hide his contempt for his companions' stupidity. They complained that he was conceited; and, since he excelled only in matters which to them were unimportant, they asked satirically what he had to be conceited about. He was developing a sense of humour, and found that he had a knack of saying bitter things, which caught people on the raw; he said them because they amused him, hardly realising how much they hurt, and was much offended when he found that his victims regarded him with active dislike. The humiliations he suffered when he first went to school had caused in him a shrinking from his fellows which he could never entirely overcome; he remained shy and silent. But though he did everything to alienate the sympathy of other boys he longed with all his heart for the popularity which to some was so easily accorded. These from his distance he admired extravagantly; and though he was inclined to be more sarcastic with them than with others, though he made little jokes at their expense, he would have given anything to change places with them.”
