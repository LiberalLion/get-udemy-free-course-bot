      “Do not, under any circumstances, belittle a work of fiction by trying to turn it into a carbon copy of real life; what we search for in fiction is not so much reality but the epiphany of truth.”
  
      “Thank you for sending me a copy of your book. I'll waste no time reading it.”
  
      “Some say life is the thing, but I prefer reading.”
  
      “Books are the bees which carry the quickening pollen from one to another mind.”
  
      “Each book was a world unto itself, and in it I took refuge.”
  
      “Censorship ends in logical completeness when nobody is allowed to read any books except the books that nobody 
      “A book is the only place in which you can examine a fragile thought without breaking it, or explore an explosive idea without fear it will go off in your face. It is one of the few havens remaining where a man's mind can get both provocation and privacy.”
  
      “Of course anyone who truly loves books buys more of them than he or she can hope to read in one fleeting lifetime. A good book, resting unopened in its slot on a shelf, full of majestic potentiality, is the most comforting sort of intellectual wallpaper.”
  
      “What an author doesn't know could fill a book.”
  
      “What he knew, he knew from books, and books lied, they made things prettier.”
  
      “The old man was peering intently at the shelves. 'I'll have to admit that he's a very competent scholar.'
      “I often find that a novel, even a well-written and compelling novel, can become a blur to me soon after I've finished reading it. I recollect perfectly the feeling of reading it, the mood I occupied, but I am less sure about the narrative details. It is almost as if the book were, as Wittgenstein said of his propositions, a ladder to be climbed and then discarded after it has served its purpose.”
  
      “Just like heaven. Ever’body wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It’s just in their head. They’re all the time talkin’ about it, but it’s jus’ in their head.”
  
      “For a moment I was distracted. Books always did that to me... I liked the creamy pages, the smell of ink, all the secrets locked inside.”
  
      “My bookcase is all yours."
      “Every night, I have to read a book, so that my mind will stop thinking about things that I stress about.”
  
      “Books and doors are the same thing. You open them, and you go through into another world.”
  
      “One glance at (a book) and you hear the voice of another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millenia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.”
  
      “Quiet people have the loudest minds.”
  
      “Books are the most wonderful friends in the world. When you meet them and pick them up, they are always ready to give you a few ideas. When you put them down, they never get mad; when you take them up again, they seem to enrich you all the more.”
  
      “The true birthplace is that wherein for the first time one looks intelligently upon oneself; my first homelands have been books, and to a lesser degree schools.”
  
      “Books are like seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the most unpromising soil.”
  
      “Reading is reading - no matter what the material.”
  
      “Bloodthirsty little beasts. Never trust a duck.”
  
      “....a good book can teach you about the world and about yourself. You learn more than how to read better; you also learn more about life. You become wiser. Not just more knowledgeable - books that provide nothing but information can produce that result. But wiser, in the sense that you are more deeply aware of the great and enduring truths of human life.”
  
      “What art offers is space – a certain breathing room for the spirit.”
  
      “Some like to believe it's the book that chooses the person.”
  
      “Have you thought of an ending?"
      “Books have a way of finding their way into our lives, usually, right when we need them the most.”
  
      “Tis the good reader that makes the good book.”
