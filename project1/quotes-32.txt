      “It's too late to apologize for I have already forgiven you." -FitzChivalry Farseer”
  
      “The good, the admirable reader identifies himself not with the boy or the girl in the book, but with the mind that conceived and composed that book.”
  
      “Books are like truth serum-- if you don't read, you can't figure out what's real.”
  
      “As we expand our knowledge of good books, we shrink the circle of men whose company we appreciate.”
  
      “The feel of them (books) and the smell of them. A bookshop was like an Aladdin's cave for me. Entire worlds and lives can be found just behind that glossy cover. All you had to do was look." Claire (Watermelon)”
  
      “She’d felt it before, she felt it now: the pull to fall in with him, to fall into him, to lose her sense of self.”
  
      “No book can ever be finished. While working on it we learn just enough to find it immature the moment we turn away from it”
  
      “Weren’t all books ultimately related? After all, the same letters filled them, just arranged in a different order. Which meant that, in a certain way, every book was contained in every other!”
  
      “From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood.”
  
      “I don't want anyone writing in to point out that I spend too much money on books, many of which I will never read. I know that already. I certainly intend to read all of them, more or less. My intentions are good. Anyway, it's my money. And I'll bet you do it too.”
  
      “Nothing ever invented provides such sustenance, such infinite reward for time spent, as a good book.”
  
      “I truly believe that if you have more friends than books, you have too many friends. Or not enough books. Probably both.”
  
      “When I began writing The Night Bookmobile, it was a story about a woman's secret life as a reader. As I worked it also became a story about the claims that books place on their readers, the imbalance between our inner and outer lives, a cautionary tale of the seductions of the written word. It became a vision of the afterlife as a library, of heaven as a funky old camper filled with everything you've ever read. What is this heaven? What is it we desire from the hours, weeks, lifetimes we devote to books? What would you sacrifice to sit in that comfy chair with perfect light for an afternoon in eternity, reading the perfect book, forever?”
  
      “The words that strike us are those that awake an echo in a zone we have already made our own—the place where we live—and the vibration enables us to find fresh starting points within ourselves.”
  
      “Our private tastes in books showed a hint of our secret selves.”
  
      “It is time to browse through the precious books that have meant the most to you that you may rediscover illuminating phrases and sentences to light your pathway to the future...”
  
      “If you haven't cried at least once while writing a chapter of your inspirational book, then you have to ask yourself if your're writing fiction.”
  
      “I would like my personal reading map to resemble a map of the British Empire circa 1900.”
  
      “Maybe the books can get us half out of the cave. They just might stop us from making the same damm insane mistakes!”
  
      “Writing a long and substantial book is like having a friend and companion at your side, to whom you can always turn for comfort and amusement, and whose society becomes more attractive as a new and widening field of interest is lighted in the mind.”
  
      “When I was in my twenties and broke, I'd buy books before food. A meal will sustain you for a few hours, a good book will sustain you for life.”
  
      “I read because one life isn't enough, and in the page of a book I can be anybody.”
  
      “Always buy pornographic books in hardback because they're easier to hold with one hand.”
  
      “We are made whole
      “I love to lose myself in other men's minds.... Books think for me.”
  
      “I myself grew up to be not only a Hero, but also a Writer. When I was an adult, I rewrote 
      “The poet must always, in every instance, have the vibrant word... that by it's trenchancy can so wound my soul that it whimpers.... One must know and recognize not merely the direct but the secret power of the word; one must be able to give one's writing unexpected effects. It must have a hectic, anguished vehemence, so that it rushes past like a gust of air, and it must have a latent, roistering tenderness so that it creeps and steals one's mind; it must be able to ring out like a sea-shanty in a tremendous hour, in the time of the tempest, and it must be able to sigh like one who, in tearful mood, sobs in his inmost heart.”
  
      “The only friends I have are the dead who have bequeathed their writings to me--I have no others.”
  
      “Before you sleep, read something that is exquisite, and worth remembering.”
  
      “Cosa farei senza libri? Ne ho la casa piena, eppure non mi bastano mai. Vorrei avere una giornata di trentasei ore per poter leggere a mio piacere. Tengo libri di tutte le dimensioni: da tasca, da borsa, da valigia, da taschino, da scaffale, da tavolo. E ne porto sempre uno con me. Non si sa mai: se trovo un momento di tempo, se mi fanno aspettare in un ufficio, che sia alla posta o dal medico, tiro fuori il mio libro e leggo. Quando ho il naso su una pagina non sento la fatica dell'attesa. E, come dice Ortega y Gasset, in un libro mi "impaeso", a tal punto che mi è difficile spaesarmi. Esco dai libri con le pupille dilatate. Lo considero il piacere più grande, più sicuro, più profondo della mia vita.”
