      “... so this is for us.
      “The world is dark, and light is precious.
      “The greatest gift is the passion for reading.
      “I think books are like people, in the sense that they'll turn up in your life when you most need them.”
  
      “You can never, never have too many books”
  
      “When we read, we decide when, where, how long, and about what. One of the few places on earth that it is still possible to experience an instant sense of freedom and privacy is anywhere you open up a good book and begin to read. When we read silently, we are alone with our own thoughts and one other voice. We can take our time, consider, evaluate, and digest what we read—with no commercial interruptions, no emotional music or special effects manipulation. And in spite of the advances in electronic information exchange, the book is still the most important medium for presenting ideas of substance and value, still the only real home of literature.”
  
      “The book thief has struck for the first time – the beginning of an illustrious career.”
  
      “To live is to have worries and uncertainties. Keep them inside, and they will destroy you for certain--leaving behind a person so callused that emotion can find no root in his heart.”
  
      “Nothing was truly unbearable if you had something to read.”
  
      “Just as one spoils the stomach by overfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and choke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.”
  
      “What is the quality you most like in a man? 
      “All of us can think of a book... that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.”
  
      “A novel is not an allegory.... It is the sensual experience of another world. If you don't enter that world, hold your breath with the characters and become involved in their destiny, you won't be able to empathize, and empathy is at the heart of the novel. This is how you read a novel: you inhale the experience. So start breathing.”
  
      “Books are love letters (or apologies) passed between us, adding a layer of conversation beyond our spoken words.”
  
      “I wanted a library like this...[] A cave of words that I'd made myself.”
  
      “Yet if women are so flighty, fickle, changeable, susceptible, and inconstant (as some clerks would have us believe), why is it that their suitors have to resort to such trickery to have their way with them? And why don't women quickly succumb to them, without the need for all this skill and ingenuity in conquering them? For there is no need to go to war for a castle that is already captured. (...)
      “...and Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the work-a-day world again.”
  
      “Second-hand books are wild books, homeless books; they have come together in vast flocks of variegated feather, and have a charm which the domesticated volumes of the library lack. Besides, in this random miscellaneous company we may rub against some complete stranger who will, with luck, turn into the best friend we have in the world.”
  
      “I remember the hours I had spent in Father's library, drugging myself with books so I could forget my doom for an hour..”
  
      “Men, I thought, were more trouble than they were worth. Really, one should stick to books where one sees the hero coming a mile off.”
  
      “I like to imagine that, on the day after my last, my library and I will crumble together, so that even when I am no more I'll still be with my books.”
  
      “The flesh is sad, alas, and I have read all the books.”
  
      “We are what we love to read, and when we admit to loving a book, we admit that the book represents some aspect of ourselves truly, whether it is that we are suckers for romance or pining for adventure or secretly fascinated by crime.”
  
      “I see all of us reading ourselves away from ourselves, 
      “I think of my pile of old paperbacks, their pages gone wobbly, like they'd once belonged to the sea.”
  
      “There is only one genre in fiction, the genre is called book.”
  
      “Associate with the noblest people you can find; read the best books; live with the mighty; but learn to be happy alone.”
  
      “Among the many worlds which man did not receive as a gift of nature, but which he created with his own mind, the world of books is the greatest. Every child, scrawling his first letters on his slate and attempting to read for the first time, in so doing, enters an artificial and complicated world; to know the laws and rules of this world completely and to practice them perfectly, no single human life is long enough. Without words, without writing, and without books there would be no history, there could be no concept of humanity. And if anyone wants to try to enclose in a small space in a single house or single room, the history of the human spirit and to make it his own, he can only do this in the form of a collection of books.”
  
      “Tell me I didn't imagine it, Leo. Tell me that even though our bodies were in seperate states, our star selves shared an enchanted place. Tell me that right around noon today (eastern time) you had the strangest sensation: a tiny chill on your shoulder...a flutter in the heart...a shadow of strawberry-banana crossing your tongue...tell me you whispered my name.”
  
      “I love that books allow us to experience other lives without us ever having to change where we live or who we are.”
