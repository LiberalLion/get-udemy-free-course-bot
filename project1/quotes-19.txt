      “Adult librarians are like lazy bakers: their patrons want a jelly doughnut, so they give them a jelly doughnut. Children’s librarians are ambitious bakers: 'You like the jelly doughnut? I’ll get you a jelly doughnut. But you should try my cruller, too. My cruller is gonna blow your mind, kid.”
  
      “I read the fuck out of every book I can get my hands on.”
  
      “An unread book does nobody any good. Stories happen in the mind of a reader, not among symbols printed on a page.”
  
      “If your library is not "unsafe," it probably isn't doing its job.”
  
      “Properly, we should read for power. Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand.”
  
      “Break the spine of one of my books and I break yours.”
  
      “It is with books as with men: a very small number play a great part.”
  
      “One day, she ventured to the palace library and was delighted to find what good company books could be.”
  
      “Just the knowledge that a good book is awaiting one at the end of a long day makes that day happier. ”
  
      “I ate them like salad, books were my sandwich for lunch, my tiffin and dinner and midnight munch. I tore out the pages, ate them with salt, doused them with relish, gnawed on the bindings, turned the chapters with my tongue! Books by the dozen, the score and the billion. I carried so many home I was hunchbacked for years. Philosophy, art history, politics, social science, the poem, the essay, the grandiose play, you name 'em, I ate 'em.”
  
      “You have to remember that it is impossible to commit a crime while reading a book.”
  
      “The book is a film that takes place in the mind of the reader. That's why we go to movies and say, "Oh, the book is better.”
  
      “She read books quickly and compulsively, paperback after paperback, as if she might drift away without the anchor of the printed page.”
  
      “Books. They are lined up on shelves or stacked on a table. There they are wrapped up in their jackets, lines of neat print on nicely bound pages. They look like such orderly, static things. Then you, the reader come along. You open the book jacket, and it can be like opening the gates to an unknown city, or opening the lid of a treasure chest. You read the first word and you're off on a journey of exploration and discovery.”
  
      “I write to find strength.
      “Just handle the books gently and you’ll get along fine.”
  
      “October knew, of course, that the action of turning a page, of ending a chapter or of shutting a book, did not end a tale. Having admitted that, he would also avow that happy endings were never difficult to find: "It is simply a matter," he explained to April, "of finding a sunny place in a garden, where the light is golden and the grass is soft; somewhere to rest, to stop reading, and to be content.”
  
      “Nudge threw her arms around my neck. 'I love you Max! I love all of us too!'
      “I don’t have many friends, not the living, breathing sort at any rate. And I don’t mean that in a sad and lonely way; I’m just not the type of person who accumulates friends or enjoys crowds. I’m good with words, but not spoken kind; I’ve often thought what a marvelous thing it would be if I could only conduct relationships on paper. And I suppose, in a sense, that’s what I do, for I’ve hundreds of the other sort, the friends contained within bindings, pages after glorious pages of ink, stories that unfold the same way every time but never lose their joy, that take me by the hand and lead me through doorways into worlds of great terror and rapturous delight. Exciting, worthy, reliable companions - full of wise counsel, some of them - but sadly ill-equipped to offer the use of a spare bedroom for a month or two.”
  
      “And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.”
  
      “When I'm really into a novel, I'm seeing the world differently during that time— not just for the hour or so in the day when I get to read. I'm actually walking around in a haze, spellbound by the book and looking at everything through a different prism.”
  
      “An active mind didn't need distractions in its physical environment. It needed a collection of outstanding books and a good lamp. Maybe some cheese and crackers.”
  
      “How does it feel, anyway?"
      “Writers are really people who write books not because they are poor, but because they are dissatisfied with the books which they could buy but do not like.”
  
      “There were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library, most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H.”
  
      “People talk about books being an escape, but here on the tube, this one feels more like a lifeline...The motion of the train makes her head rattle, but her eyes lock on the words the way a figure skater might choose a focal point as she spins, and just like that, she's grounded again.”
  
      “And she never could remember; and ever since that day what Lucy means by a good story is a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the Magician's Book.”
  
      “(in response to the question: what do you think of e-books and Amazon’s Kindle?)
      “Censorship is the child of fear and the father of ignorance.”
  
      “الأمر الوحيد الذي أندم عليه هو أنه لن يتسنى لي قراءة كل الكتب التي أود قرائتها.”
