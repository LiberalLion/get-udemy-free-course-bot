      “Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print.
      “Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become.”
  
      “When you handle books all day long, every new one is a friend and a temptation.”
  
      “[I]t's not just the books under fire now that worry me. It is the books that will never be written. The books that will never be read. And all due to the fear of censorship. As always, young readers will be the real losers.”
  
      “She should have done science, not spent all her time with her head in novels. Novels gave you a completely false idea about life, they told lies and they implied there were endings when in reality there were no endings, everything just went on and on and on.”
  
      “You forget everything. The hours slip by. You travel in your chair through centuries you seem seem to see before you, your thoughts are caught up in the story, dallying with the details or following the course of the plot, you enter into characters, so that it seems as if it were your own heart beating beneath their costumes.”
  
      “You see, unlike in the movies, there is no THE END sign flashing at the end of books. When I've read a book, I don't feel like I've finished anything. So I start a new one.”
  
      “[Public] libraries should be open to all—except the censor.
      “I mean, most people want to escape. Get out of their heads. Out of their lives. Stories are the easiest way to do that.”
  
      “One day I would have all the books in the world, shelves and shelves of them. I would live my life in a tower of books. I would read all day long and eat peaches. And if any young knights in armor dared to come calling on their white chargers and plead with me to let down my hair, I would pelt them with peach pits until they went home.”
  
      “Some books leave us free and some books make us free.”
  
      “And books, they offer one hope -- that a whole universe might open up from between the covers, and falling into that universe, one is saved.”
  
      “those of us who read because we love it more than anything, who feel about bookstores the way some people feel about jewelers...”
  
      “Her reputation for reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic.”
  
      “I love everything that is old; old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wines.”
  
      “Never trust a man who reads only one book.”
  
      “القراءة المبالغ فيها لا تجعل منا أذكياء. بعض الناس يبتلعون الكتب, وهم يفعلون ذلك بدون فاصل للتفكير الضروري. وهو ضروري لكي يهضم المقروء ويبنى ويتبنى ويُفهم”
  
      “Thus I rediscovered what writers have always known (and have told us again and again): books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told.”
  
      “All books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hours, and the books of all Time.”
  
      “A house without books is like a room without windows. No man has a right to bring up his children without surrounding them with books, if he has the means to buy them. It is a wrong to his family. He cheats them! Children learn to read by being in the presence of books. The love of knowledge comes with reading and grows upon it.”
  
      “With my eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw its fragrance deep inside me. This was enough to make me happy. ”
  
      “You are a total stranger and you want to take my library book.”
  
      “Books, the children of the brain.”
  
      “Libraries raised me.”
  
      “Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment.”
  
      “أَعَزُّ مَكانٍ في الدُنَى سَرجُ سابِحٍ
      “…only then did I wake out of the book.”
  
      “There are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street. There are images tucked away in books that live more vividly than many men and women. There are phrases from literary works that have a positively human personality. There are passages from my own writing that chill me with fright, so distinctly do I feel them as people, so sharply outlined do they appear against the walls of my room, at night, in shadows... I've written sentences whose sound, read out loud or silently (impossible to hide their sound), can only be of something that acquired absolute exteriority and a full-fledged soul.”
  
      “They had only ever discussed books but what, in this life, is more personal than books?”
  
      “You don't put your life into your books, you find it there.”
