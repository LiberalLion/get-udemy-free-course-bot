      “Tis the good reader that makes the good book; in every book he finds passages which seem confidences or asides hidden from all else and unmistakenly meant for his ear; the profit of books is according to the sensibility of the reader; the profoundest thought or passion sleeps as in a mine, until it is discovered by an equal mind and heart.”
  
      “Woe be to him that reads but one book.”
  
      “Now begin in the middle, and later learn the beginning; the end will take care of itself.”

      “Do you think she is?" Her voice trembled. Her heart throbbed as she waited for him to answer. "You think they've killed her?"
      “Remember, when you don’t know what to do, it never hurts to play Scrabble. It’s like reading the I Ching or tea leaves.”
  
      “Book burnings. Always the forerunners. Heralds of the stake, the ovens, the mass graves.”
  
      “The reason a writer writes a book is to forget a book and the reason a reader reads one is to remember it. ”
  
      “In a library, no empty shelf remains empty for long.”

They’re Caesar’s praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, ‘Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.’ Most of us can’t rush around, talk to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we haven’t time, money or that many friends. The things you’re looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book.”
  
      “However much you study, you cannot know without action. 
      “A tough life needs a tough language—and that is what poetry is. That is what literature offers—a language powerful enough to say how it is.”

      “Literature is the real life of imaginary people.”
