      “I never desire to converse with a man who has written more than he has read.”
  
      “Right now, we're living in an ugly chapter of our lives, but books always get better!”
  
      “You read a book for the story, for each of its words," Gordy said, "and you draw your cartoons for the story, for each of the words and images. And, yeah, you need to take that seriously, but you should also read and draw because really good books and cartoons give you a boner."
      “Books, books, books!
      “Reading is my passion and my escape since I was 5 years old. Overall, children don't realize the magic that can live inside their own heads. Better even then any movie.”
  
      “I care more about the people in books than the people I see every day.”
  
      “it is nice that nobody writes as they talk and that the printed language is different from the spoken otherwise you could not lose yourself in books and of course you do you completely do.”
  
      “أمران سيجعلانك أكثر حكمة...
      “This will never be a civilized country until we expend more money for books than we do for chewing gum.”
  
      “But her grandmother had never suggested she could think the same of Scarlet. You'll be fine, she always said, after a skinned knee, after a broken arm, after her first youthfull heartbreak. You'll be fine, because you're strong, like me.”
  
      “Before she came ill, David's mother would often tell him that stories were alive. They weren't alive in the way that people were alive, or even dogs or cats. (...) Stories were different, though: they came alive in the telling. Without a human voice to read them aloud, or a pair of wide eyes following them by torch light beneath a blanket, they had no real existence in our world. (...) They lay dormant, hoping for the chance to emerge. Once someone started to read them, they could begin to change. They could take root in the imagination and transform the reader. Stories wanted to be read, David's mother would whisper. They needed it. It was the reason they forced themselves from their world into ours. They wanted us to give them life.”
  
      “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them”
  
      “I wanted to know what it was like to be a drug addict, and have an eating disorder, and have a loved one die, and fall in love. I saw my friends going through these things, I saw the world going through these things, and I needed to understand them. I needed to make sense of them. Books didn’t make me wallow in darkness, darkness made me wallow in books, and it was books that showed me there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
  
      “Yo soy carne muerta. Translation: I am dead meat.”
  
      “Just as music is noise that makes sense, a painting is colour that makes sense, so a story is life that makes sense.”
  
      “Reading was not a fallback position for her but an ideal state of being.”
  
      “if a book isn't self-explanatory, then it isn't worth reading.”
  
      “When I want to read a novel, I write one.”
  
      “My last refuge, my books: simple pleasures, like finding wild onions by the side of a road, or requited love.”
  
      “I read in self-defense.”
  
      “The library was a little old shabby place. Francie thought it was beautiful. The feeling she had about it was as good as the feeling she had about church. She pushed open the door and went in. She liked the combined smell of worn leather bindings, library past and freshly inked stamping pads better than she liked the smell of burning incense at high mass.”
  
      “Well, it seems to me that there are books that tell stories, and then there are books that tell truths... The first kind, they show you life like you want it to be. With villains getting what they deserve and the hero seeing what a fool he's been and marrying the heroine and happy endings and all that... But the second kind, they show you life more like it is... The first kind makes you cheerful and contented, but the second kind shakes you up.”
  
      “The wise man reads both books and life itself.”
  
      “Any book worth banning is a book worth reading.”
  
      “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.”
  
      “A wonderful thing about a book, in contrast to a computer screen, is that you can take it to bed with you.”
  
      “One of the poets, whose name I cannot recall, has a passage, which I am unable at the moment to remember, in one of his works, which for the time being has slipped my mind, which hits off admirably this age-old situation.”
  
      “I've forgotten most of what I've read and, frankly, it never seemed very important to me or to the world.”
  
      “The book was in her lap; she had read no further. The power to change one’s life comes from a paragraph, a lone remark. The lines that penetrate us are slender, like the flukes that live in river water and enter the bodies of swimmers. She was excited, filled with strength. The polished sentences had arrived, it seemed, like so many other things, at just the right time. How can we imagine what our lives should be without the illumination of the lives of others?”
  
      “In Tereza’s eyes, books were the emblems of a secret brotherhood. For she had but a single weapon against the world of crudity surrounding her: the novels. She had read any number of them, from Fielding to Thomas Mann. They not only offered the possibility of an imaginary escape from a life she found unsatisfying; they also had a meaning for her as physical objects: she loved to walk down the street with a book under her arm. It had the same significance for her as an elegant cane from the dandy a century ago. It differentiated her from others.”
