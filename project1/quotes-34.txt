      “Books can truly change our lives: the lives of those who read them, the lives of those who write them. Readers and writers alike discover things they never knew about the world and about themselves.”
  
      “Books are like oxygen to a deep-sea diver," she had once said. "Take them away and you might as well begin counting the bubbles.”
  
      “Books fall open, you fall in”
  
      “There are many horrible sights in the multiverse. Somehow, though, to a soul attuned to the subtle rhythms of a library, there are few worse sights than a hole where a book ought to be.
      “Learning became her. She loved the smell of the book from the shelves, the type on the pages, the sense that the world was an infinite but knowable place. Every fact she learned seemed to open another question, and for every question there was another book.”
  
      “Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art.”
  
      “That's what this country needs -- more books!”
  
      “Literature is the safe and traditional vehicle through which we learn about the world and pass on values from on generation to the next. Books save lives.”
  
      “و من الممكن أن تمل القراءة طبيعي فعندما يمل الإنسان كل شئ تكون الكتب أول الضحايا”
  
      “If you cannot read all your books, at any rate handle, or as it were, fondle them – peer into them, let them fall open where they will, read from the first sentence that arrests the eye, set them back on the shelves with your own hands, arrange them on your own plan so that if you do not know what is in them, you at least know where they are. Let them be your friends; let them at any rate be your acquaintances. If they cannot enter the circle of your life, do not deny them at least a nod of recognition.”
  
      “There's no better way to inform and expand you mind on a regular basis than to get into the habit of reading good literature.”
  
      “anyone who’s worth anything reads just what he likes, as the mood takes him, and with extravagant enthusiasm.”
  
      “A book is a wonderful present. Though it may grow worn, it will never grow old.”
  
      “Anything can become a children's book if you give it to a child...Children are actually the best (and worst) audience for literature because they have no patience with pretence.”
  
      “I smiled at the stacks, inhaling again. Hundreds of thousands of pages that had never been turned, waiting for me. The shelves were a warm, blond wood, piled with spines of every color. Staff picks were arranged on tables, glossy covers reflecting the light back at me. Behind the little cubby where the cashier sat, ignoring us, stairs covered with rich burgundy carpet led up to the worlds unknown. 'I could just live here,' I said.”
  
      “If every library is in some sense a reflection of its readers, it is also an image of that which we are not, and cannot be.”
  
      “The dirtiest book of all is the expurgated book.”
  
      “All his life, Klaus had believed that if you read enough books, you could solve any problem, but now he wasn't so sure.”
  
      “The act of true reading is in its very essence democratic. Consider the nature of what happens when we read a book - and I mean, of course, a work of literature, not an instruction manual or a textbook - in private, unsupervised, un-spied-on, alone. It isn't like a lecture: it's like a conversation. There's a back-and-forthness about it. The book proposes, the reader questions, the book responds, the reader considers. We bring our own preconceptions and expectations, our own intellectual qualities, and our limitations, too, our own previous experiences of reading, our own temperament, our own hopes and fears, our own personality to the encounter.”
  
      “But at night, when the library lamps are lit, the outside world disappears and nothing but the space of books remains in existence. ”
  
      “Un libro leído a medias es una aventura amorosa incompleta.”
  
      “أنا أخبئ بين أقفاص صدري أوجاع نساء الأرض ودموع الصغار ،
      “She took a deep breath, "Last chance. Are you in need of rescuing?" 
      “He had no money and no home; he lived entirely on the road of the racing circuit, sleeping in empty stalls, carrying with him only a saddle, his rosary, and his books....The books were the closest thing he had to furniture, and he lived in them the way other men live in easy chairs.”
  
      “Books have souls. Or so romantics like me tend to think.”
  
      “…books are always good company if you have the right sort. Let me pick out some for you.' And Mrs. Jo made a bee-line to the well-laden shelves, which were the joy of her heart and the comfort of her life.”
  
      “I believe in books.”
  
      “Fast reading of a great novel will get us the plot. It will get us names, a shadowy idea of characters, a sketch of settings. It will not get us subtleties, small differentiations, depth of emotion and observation, multilayered human experience, the appreciation of simile and metaphor, any sense of context, any comparison with other novels, other writers. Fast reading will not get us cadence and complexities of style and language. It will not get us anything that enters not just the conscious mind but the unconscious. It will not allow the book to burrow down into our memory and become part of ourselves, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom and vicarious experience which helps to form us as complete human beings. It will not develop our awareness or add to the sum of our knowledge and intelligence. Read parts of a newspaper quickly or an encyclopaedia entry, or a fast-food thriller, but do not insult yourself or a book which has been created with its author's painstakingly acquired skill and effort, by seeing how fast you can dispose of it.”
