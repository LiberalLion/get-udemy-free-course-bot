      “As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music. And, as you read and re-read, the book of course participates in the creation of you, your thoughts and feelings, the size and temper of your soul.”
  
      “The shelf was filled with books that were hard to read, that could devastate and remake one's soul, and that, when they were finished, had a kick like a mule.”
  
      “You could write a book about things that you can't find on-line.”
  
      “A lot of the people who read a bestselling novel, for example, do not read much other fiction. By contrast, the audience for an obscure novel is largely composed of people who read a lot. That means the least popular books are judged by people who have the highest standards, while the most popular are judged by people who literally do not know any better. An American who read just one book this year was disproportionately likely to have read ‘The Lost Symbol’, by Dan Brown. He almost certainly liked it.”
  
      “Be as careful of the books you read, as of the company you keep; for your habits and character will be as much influenced by the former as the latter.”
  
      “This is the most important thing about me--I'm a card-carrying reader. All I really want to do is sit and read or lie down and read or eat and read or shit and read. I'm a trained reader. I want a job where I get paid for reading books. And I don't have to make reports on what I read or to apply what I read.”
  
      “There are books so alive that you're always afraid that while you weren't reading, the book has gone and changed, has shifted like a river; while you went on living, it went on living too, and like a river moved on and moved away. No one has stepped twice into the same river. But did anyone ever step twice into the same book?”
  
      “So here is my story, may it bring
      “I hate to lend a book I love…it never seems quite the same when it comes back to me…”
  
      “But there is in everything a reasonable division of labour. I have written the book, and nothing on earth would induce me to read it.”
  
      “Beware you be not swallowed up in books! An ounce of love is worth a pound of knowledge.”
  
      “He ate and drank the precious words,
      “I’d volunteer to go to prison, as long as there are books. Because with books I am free.”
  
      “Allowing yourself to stop reading a book - at page 25, 50, or even, less frequently, a few chapters from the end - is a rite of passage in a reader's life, the literary equivalent of a bar mitzvah or a communion, the moment at which you look at yourself and announce: Today I am an adult. I can make my own decisions.”
  
      “What is wonderful about great literature is that it transforms the man who reads it towards the condition of the man who wrote.”
  
      “I can think of few better ways to introduce a child to books than to let her stack them, upend them, rearrange them, and get her fingerprints all over them.”
  
      “Any book which inspires us to lead a better life is a good book.”
  
      “Apa gunanya banyak baca buku
      “The library is like a candy store where everything is free.”
  
      “We lusty bibliophiles know that reading, unlike just about anything else, is both good for you and loads of fun.”
  
      “Was there ever a more horrible blasphemy than the statement that all the knowledge of God is confined to this or that book? How dare men call God infinite, and yet try to compress Him within the covers of a little book!”
  
      “To sit alone in the lamplight with a book spread out before you and hold intimate converse with men of unseen generations - such is pleasure beyond compare.”
  
      “Un bon livre, Marcus, est un livre que l’on regrette d’avoir terminé.”
  
      “What is reading but silent conversation.”
  
      “Authors do not choose a story to write, the story chooses us.”
  
      “Before he had lost his sight, the maester had loved books as much as Samwell Tarly did. He understood the way that you could sometimes fall right into them, as if each page was a hole into another world.”
  
      “You've read half the books in this house? This whole house?" 
      “You don't spend your life hanging around books without learning a thing or two.”
  
      “A book is a mirror: if an ape looks into it an apostle is hardly likely to look out.”
