      “Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,
      “...Something we once loved, and love now, in the shape of a book. Maybe eBooks are going to take over, one day, but not until those whizzkids in Silicon Valley invent a way to bend the corners, fold the spine, yellow the pages, add a coffee ring or two and allow the plastic tablet to fall open at a favorite page.”
  
      “She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain”
  
      “I was flipping channels, watching this cheerleading program on MTV. They took a field hockey girl and “transformed” her into a cheerleader by the end of the show. I was just wondering: what if she liked field hockey better?”
  
      “CUSTOMER: If I were to, say... meet the love of my life in this bookshop, what section do you think they would be standing in?”

      “You're either reading a book or you're not.”
  
      “Reading is sometimes thought of as a form of escapism, and it’s a common turn of phrase to speak of getting lost in a book.

      “All books are either dreams or swords,

      “A Book 
      “And what would happen if we never read the classics? There comes a point in life, it seems to me, where you have to decide whether you're a Person of Letters or merely someone who loves books, and I'm beginning to see that the book lovers have more fun. ”
  
      “A book is an arrangement of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numerals, and about eight punctuation marks, and people can cast their eyes over these and envision the eruption of Mount Vesuvius or the Battle of Waterloo.”
  
      “Амьдрал гэж нэг иймэрхүү авсаархан ном байлаа гэхэд, санаандгүй сөхөхөд тааралдах тохиолдлын ганц өгүүлбэрт л уг номыг унших учир шалтгаан бүрэн шингээстэй бий.”
  
      “With no reason to hide these words I feel, and no reason to talk about the books I read, but still, I do.”
  
      “A book is a version of the world. If you do not like it, ignore it; or offer your own version in return.”
  
      “There isn’t any particular relationship between the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.”

      “He fed his spirit with the bread of books”
  
      “That's the thing about a great book. Every time you read it, it's different, because you're different. You've changed since the last time you picked it up, things have happened to you.”
  
      “I took to the Bodleian library as to a lover and ... would sit long hours in Bodley's arms to emerge, blinking and dazed with the smell and feel of all those books.”
  
      “For the last several days I've had the sudden and general urge to buy a new book. I've stopped off at a few bookstores around the city, and while I've looked at hundreds and hundreds of books in that time, I have not found the one book that will satisfy my urge. It's not as if I don't have anything to read; there's a tower of perfectly good unread books next to my bed, not to mention the shelves of books in the living room I've been meaning to reread. I find myself, maddeningly, hungry for the next one, as yet unknown. I no longer try to analyze this hunger; I capitulated long ago to the book lust that's afflicted me most of my life. I know enough about the course of the disease to know I'll discover something soon.”
  
      “Maybe Heaven will be a library and then I might get to finish my ‘to-read’ list.”
