      “I am a product [...of] endless books. My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them. There were books in the study, books in the drawing room, books in the cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic, books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents' interest, books readable and unreadable, books suitable for a child and books most emphatically not. Nothing was forbidden me. In the seemingly endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the shelves. I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass.”
  
      “Don't join the book burners. Don't think you're going to conceal faults by concealing evidence that they ever existed. Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every book...”
  
      “No two persons ever read the same book.”
  
      “I like libraries. It makes me feel comfortable and secure to have walls of words, beautiful and wise, all around me. I always feel better when I can see that there is something to hold back the shadows.”
  
      “Reading is that fruitful miracle of a communication in the midst of solitude.”
  
      “There is no Frigate like a Book 
      “I love the smell of book ink in the morning.”
  
      “I understood books. I did not understand boys—especially alien boys.”
  
      “All I have learned, I learned from books.”
  
      “At one magical instant in your early childhood, the page of a book—that string of confused, alien ciphers—shivered into meaning. Words spoke to you, gave up their secrets; at that moment, whole universes opened. You became, irrevocably, a reader.”
  
      “She was fascinated with words. To her, words were things of beauty, each like a magical powder or potion that could be combined with other words to create powerful spells.”
  
      “There are too many books in the world to read in a single lifetime; you have to draw the line somewhere.”
  
      “Rainy days should be spent at home with a cup of tea and a good book.”
  
      “Some books are undeservedly forgotten; none are undeservedly remembered.”
  
      “In the shop we buy and sell them, but in truth books have no owner. Every book you see here has been somebody’s best friend.”
  
      “When I open them, most of the books have the smell of an earlier time leaking out between the pages - a special odor of the knowledge and emotions that for ages have been calmly resting between the covers. Breathing it in, I glance through a few pages before returning each book to its shelf.”
  
      “I am eternally grateful for my knack of finding in great books, some of them very funny books, reason enough to feel honored to be alive, no matter what else might be going on.”
  
      “. . . I lay on the bed and lost myself in the stories. 
      “A book is more than a verbal structure or series of verbal structures; it is the dialogue it establishes with its reader and the intonation it imposes upon his voice and the changing and durable images it leaves in his memory. A book is not an isolated being: it is a relationship, an axis of innumerable relationships.”
  
      “
      “Personally, I believe “Young Adult” to be an arbitrary title that means the book "Can be enjoyed by anyone/Has a main character who’s not quite an adult/Isn’t really boring.”
  
      “Even a book can be dangerous in the wrong hands, and when that happens, you blame the hands, but you also read the book.”
  
      “Always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.”
  
      “Books can be dangerous. The best ones should be labeled ‘This could change your life’.”
  
      “There are few sights sadder than a ruined book.”
  
      “Never lend books, for no one ever returns them; the only books I have in my library are books that other folks have lent me.”
  
      “We're all strangers connected by what we reveal, what we share, what we take away--our stories. I guess that's what I love about books--they are thin strands of humanity that tether us to one another for a small bit of time, that make us feel less alone or even more comfortable with our aloneness, if need be.”
  
      “I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.”
  
      “Literature is my Utopia”
  
      “Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.”
