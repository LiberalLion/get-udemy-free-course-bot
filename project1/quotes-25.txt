      “It would be inappropiate, undignified, at 38, to conduct friendships or love affairs with the ardour or intensity of a 22 year old. Falling in love like that? Writing poetry? Crying at pop songs? Dragging people into photobooths? Taking a whole day to make a compilation tape? Asking people if they wanted to share your bed, just for company? If you quoted Bob Dylan or TS Eliot or, god forbid, Brecht at someone these days they would smile politely and step quietly backwards, and who would blame them? Ridiculous, at 38, to expect a song or book or film to change your life.”
  
      “She turned to look at him, and he was already looking at her. “I’m going to miss you when I wake up,” she whispered, because she realized that she must have fallen asleep under the sun. Arin was too real for her imagination. He was a dream.
      “Of all the inanimate objects, of all men's creations, books are the nearest to us for they contain our very thoughts, our ambitions, our indignations, our illusions, our fidelity to the truth, and our persistent leanings to error. But most of all they resemble us in their precious hold on life.”
  
      “A book is more than the sum of its materials. It is an artifact of the human mind and hand.”
  
      “My life - my personality, my habits, even my speech - is a combination of the books I choose to read, the people I choose to listen to, and the thoughts I choose to tolerate in my mind”
  
      “Books are the most tolerant of friends.”
  
      “Here's what I mean by the miracle of language. When you're falling into a good book, exactly as you might fall into a dream, a little conduit opens, a passageway between a reader's heart and a writer's, a connection that transcends the barriers of continents and generations and even death ... And here's the magic. You're different. You can never go back to being exactly the same person you were before you disappeared into that book.”
  
      “I think it is good that books still exist, but they do make me sleepy.”
  
      “All that mankind has done, thought, gained, or been; it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of books.”
  
      “I still remember the day my father took me to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books for the first time.”
  
      “No one knows as well as I how much nonsense is printed in books.”
  
      “She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could console herself.”
  
      “Overall, the library held a hushed exultation, as though the cherished volumes were all singing soundlessly within their covers.”
  
      “It looked like the sort of book described in library catalogues as 'slightly foxed', although it would be more honest to admit that it looked as though it had been badgered, wolved and possibly beared as well.”
  
      “Reading is important.
      “Books let us into their souls and lay open to us the secrets of our own."
      “Literary detection and firearms don't really go hand in hand; pen mighter than the sword and so forth. ”
  
      “How many cities have revealed themselves to me in the marches I undertook in the pursuit of books!”
  
      “Teenagers read millions of books every year. They read for entertainment and for education. They read because of school assignments and pop culture fads.
      “I don't remember ever feeling lonely; in fact, on the rare occasions when I met other children I found their games and their talk far less interesting than the adventures and dialogues I read in my books.”
  
      “Imagination is a gift given to us from God and each one of us use it differently.”
  
      “My books are friends that never fail me."
      “For once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it weakens so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which dwells in the ink pot and festers in the quill. The wretch takes to writing. ”
  
      “I took the volume to a table, opened its soft, ivory pages... and fell into it as into a pool during dry season.”
  
      “It [the book] was spinning a magic spell around her heart, sticky as a spider's web and enchantingly beautiful..”
  
      “I do, I’m afraid, understand books far more readily than I understand people. Books are so easy to get along with.”
  
      “Will I have to use a dictionary to read your book?" asked Mrs. Dodypol. "It depends," says I, "how much you used the dictionary before you read it.”
  
      “The ultimate luxury is to reread: to revisit a book to see how time has treated it, how memory has distorted it, or how my own passing years have cast a new light on it.”
  
      “A book has but one voice, but it does not instruct everyone alike.”
  
      “She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. She read books as one would breathe ether, to sink in and die.”
