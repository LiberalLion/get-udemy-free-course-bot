      “A story is not like a road to follow … it's more like a house. You go inside and stay there for a while, wandering back and forth and settling where you like and discovering how the room and corridors relate to each other, how the world outside is altered by being viewed from these windows. And you, the visitor, the reader, are altered as well by being in this enclosed space, whether it is ample and easy or full of crooked turns, or sparsely or opulently furnished. You can go back again and again, and the house, the story, always contains more than you saw the last time. It also has a sturdy sense of itself of being built out of its own necessity, not just to shelter or beguile you.”
  
      “Keep good company, read good books, love good things and cultivate soul and body as faithfully as you can”
  
      “Prometheus, thief of light, giver of light, bound by the gods, must have been a book.”
  
      “I hate books; they only teach us to talk about things we know nothing about.”
  
      “Books are a hard-bound drug with no danger of an overdose. I am the happy victim of books.”
  
      “As you grow ready for it, somewhere or other you will find what is needful for you in a book.”
  
      “I know, you've been here a year, you think these people are normal. Well, they're not. WE'RE not. I look in the library, I call up books on my desk. Old ones, because they won't let us have anything new, but I've got a pretty good idea what children are, and we're not children. Children can lose sometimes, and nobody cares. Children aren't in armies, they aren't COMMANDERS, they don't rule over forty other kids, it's more than anybody can take and not get crazy.”
  
      “The public library is where place and possibility meet.”
  
      “I love the place; the magnificent books; I require books as I require air.”
  
      “The books were legends and tales, stories from all over the Realm. These she had devoured voraciously – so voraciously, in fact, that she started to become fatigued by them. It was possible to have too much of a good thing, she reflected.
      “When at last I came upon the right book, the feeling was violent: it blew open a hole in me that made life more dangerous because I couldn't control what came through it.”
  
      “Only five books tonight, Mommy," she says.
      “Reading, for me, is like this: consumptive, pleasing, calming, as much as edifying. It's how I feel after a good dinner. That's why I do it so often: It feels wonderful. The book is mind and I insert myself into it, cover it entire, ear my way through every last slash and dot. That's something you can do with a book, unlike television or movies or the Internet. You can eat it, or mark it, like a dog does on a hydrant. ”
  
      “A book is a fragile creature, it suffers the wear of time, it fears rodents, the elements and clumsy hands. so the librarian protects the books not only against mankind but also against nature and devotes his life to this war with the forces of oblivion.”
  
      “For every book you buy, you should buy the time to read it.”
  
      “Write it down, boy. If you come across a passage in your reading that you’d like to remember, write it down in your little book; then you can read it again, memorize it, and have it whenever you wish.”
  
      “A censor is an expert in cutting remarks. A censor is a man who knows more than he thinks you ought to.”
  
      “Readers, censors know, are defined by the books they read.”
  
      “There was something appealing in thinking of a character with a secret life that her author knew nothing about. Slipping off while the author's back was turned, to find love in her own way. Showing up just in time to deliver the next bit of dialogue with an innocent face.”
  
      “In Western Civilization, our elders are books.”
  
      “Unpacking books is a revelatory activity. ”
  
      “I am a part of all I have read.”
  
      “I hate most people. And I don’t want to, it’s an awful way to be. But the human race gives me no comfort. I find myself turning to books and films for comfort still. It’s repulsive, because one’s life consists of people, not things.”
  
      “Readers are bullied in schoolyards and in locker-rooms as much as in government offices and prisons.”
  
      “The buying of more books than one can read is nothing less than the soul reaching toward infinity...”
  
      “I like books whose virtue is all drawn together in a page or two. I like sentences that don't budge though armies cross them. ”
  
      “A good book is never exhausted. It goes on whispering to you from the wall. Books perfume and give weight to a room. A bookcase is as good as a view, as the sight of a city or a river. There are dawns and sunsets in books - storms, fogs, zephyrs.
      “Success is no proof of virtue. In the case of a book, quick acclaim is presumptive evidence of a lack of substance and originality.”
  
      “Have books ‘happened’ to you? Unless your answer to that question is ‘yes,’ I’m unsure how to talk to you”
  
      “I love staring at my books for hours just trying to decide which book to read next. Doing that is almost as fun as actually reading them.”
